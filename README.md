# Domleo

A Vue component library.

This is personal project for myself to learn and practise and is vey much a work in progress.

- Vue 2 component library - [domleo-vue](./domleo-vue)
- Documentation - [domleo-docs](./domleo-docs) or [domleo.jackdomleo.dev](https://domleo.jackdomleo.dev)

## Motivation

Component libraries are quite an in-demand thing lately. I have experience building a CSS framework for a business, and I have experience building Vue components. So, I thought it'd be beneficial and fun to build my own Vue component library.

I'll start by using Vue 2 and possibly create a Vue 3 branch and see how it goes from there. I don't intend on publishing this to npm or Yarn (at least any time soon), it's just a personal project for now.

## Focus

My focus for this project will be:
- HTML semantic markup
- Accessibility
- UX
- Unit testing
- Component library architecture
- Documentation presentation and ease of use
- UI (takes less of a priority as I feel I would be wasting time initially on colours and because eventually,I want to make the UI customisable)

## Tech

Tech used in this repository:

- Vue 2 (component library - future plans to recreate using Vue 3)
- Rollup (to package up the component library)
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Nuxt (documentation website)
- Jest (unit testing)

Patterns used in this repository:

- BEM

## FAQ

1. **Q.** Why did you use Vue 2 and not Vue 3 to begin with?
   **A.** I wanted to create the documentation website using Nuxt, which currently only uses Vue 2, and you cannot import a Vue 3 component library into a Vue 2 project. I may consider creating a separate branch for Vue 3 and add to it when I can.
